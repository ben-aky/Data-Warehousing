# Data Warehousing Assignments
Two projects from the Data Warehousing course at GWU (Project 1- MySQL | Project 2- MongoDB).

# Notice
The database for Project 1 (CSV file) and the Python script that used the Faker library to create Project 2's database were provided to the class, and therefore it is not my work. <br /> Please read the license on the repository's main page if you have not already.
